<h1><center> BOOTSRAP</center></h1>

This exercise was really easy, because bootstrap it's almost just copy and past. Here and there some property change, but really okay.

The most difficult part was the navbar, that was a little hard. But for the rest i liked the exercise. Now I can work properly with bootstrap.
